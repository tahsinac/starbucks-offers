# Starbucks App: Sending The Right Offer To The Right User

## Introduction
Starbucks, perhaps one of the worldâ€™s most popular coffee shops, has a mobile rewards app through which Starbucks sends out offers to its users once every few days. These offers can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free) and every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. Some users might receive any offer during certain weeks and not all users receive the same offer.
Data such as user information, purchase history and whether or not they successfully completed an offer can be used to understand how different users behave on the app.
In this project I try to use such data and answer the following questions:
* What kind of people make up the reward app user base?
* What is the best offer for a particular user?
* How much will a user spend?
* Just how influenced is the user by an offer?


## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## File Descriptions
A jupyter notebook
